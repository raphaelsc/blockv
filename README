FUSE created to provide access to network (TBD) and memory based block devices.

Further information about network-based block device:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_block_device

How to play with it?

1) Compile project with:
   g++ --std=c++14 `pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs` virtual_blkdev_fuse.cc -o virtual_blkdev_fuse;

   NOTE: Depends on FUSE.

2) Run project as follow:
   mkdir ./mount_point;
   ./virtual_blkdev_fuse -d ./mount_point; -o allow_root;

   NOTE: allow_root option requires adding 'user_allow_other' to /etc/fuse.conf

3) Format a virtual block device with ext2 file system:
   mkfs.ext2 ./mount_point/virtual_block_device;

   NOTE: virtual-blk-fuse has installed by default a memory-based block device of 32MB.
   TODO: Add support to create new virtual block devices with arbitrary size.

4) Mount previously created ext2 filesystem with:
   mkdir ./mount_point2;
   sudo mount -t ext2 -o loop mount/virtual_block_device ./mount_point2;

   NOTE: ./mount_point2 is now home for a ext2 filesystem backed by memory RAM.
