How to play with it?

1) Compile project with: 
   g++ `pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs` virtual-blkdev-fuse.cc -o virtual-blkdev-fuse
   NOTE: Depends on FUSE.

2) Run project as follow:
   ./virtual-blkdev-fuse -d <mount_point> -o allow_root
   NOTE: allow_root option requires adding 'user_allow_other' to /etc/fuse.conf

3) Format a file system into a virtual block device located at <mount_point>:
   mkfs.ext2 mount/virtual_block_device
   NOTE: virtual-blk-fuse has installed by default a virtual block device (memory based, 32MB in size).
   TODO: Add support to create new virtual block devices with arbitrary size.

4) Mount previously created ext2 file system with:
   sudo mount -t ext2 -o loop mount/virtual_block_device <mount_point_to_fs>
